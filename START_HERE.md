# 🎵 START HERE - Music Library Organizer

## ✅ GOOD NEWS!

Your backend server is **ALREADY RUNNING** and working perfectly! ✨

- ✅ MongoDB is connected
- ✅ 20 sample songs have been loaded
- ✅ Backend running on http://localhost:5000
- ✅ All API endpoints are ready

## ⚠️ Frontend Needs a Restart

The frontend has a babel configuration caching issue. Here's how to fix it:

###  **STEP 1: Stop the Frontend Server**

In the terminal where the frontend is running (port 3000), press:
```
Ctrl + C
```

### **STEP 2: Clear Babel Cache and Restart**

Run this command in PowerShell:
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules\.cache; npm start
```

OR simply:
```powershell
npm start
```

The webpack configuration has been updated to include Babel presets directly, so it should work now!

## 🚀 Expected Result

After restarting, you should see:
```
webpack 5.x compiled successfully
```

Then your browser will open to **http://localhost:3000** showing:
