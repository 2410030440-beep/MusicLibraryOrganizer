# 🎵 HOW TO RUN YOUR MUSIC WEBSITE - EASY GUIDE! 🚀

## ⚡ SUPER SIMPLE - JUST 2 STEPS!

---

### **STEP 1: Open 2 Terminals in VS Code**

1. Open VS Code
2. Press `` Ctrl + ` `` (backtick key, below Esc)
3. Click the **"+"** icon to open 2 terminals

---

### **STEP 2: Run These Commands**

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**
```bash
npm run server
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
```bash
npm start
```

---

### **STEP 3: Open Your Browser**

Go to: **http://localhost:3000**

**THAT'S IT!** 🎉

---

## 🎮 EVEN EASIER - ONE COMMAND!

Instead of opening 2 terminals, just run this ONE command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts BOTH servers at once! 🚀

---

## ⚠️ IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG:

### Problem 1: "Port already in use"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Find what's using the port
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Kill it (replace XXXX with the PID number)
taskkill /PID XXXX /F

# Then run again
npm start
```

### Problem 2: "Can't find website"
**Solution:**
1. Make sure **BOTH** servers are running
2. Check that you see:
   - ✅ "Server running on http://localhost:5000"
   - ✅ "Local: http://localhost:3000"
3. Try: http://127.0.0.1:3000 instead

### Problem 3: "Module not found"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Reinstall everything
npm install
```

### Problem 4: "MongoDB connection error"
**Solution:**
Your website will still work! It uses YouTube, not MongoDB! Just ignore the warning.

---

## 📝 QUICK REFERENCE CARD

### Start Website:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Stop Website:
Press `Ctrl + C` in both terminals

### Restart Website:
```bash
Ctrl + C (to stop)
npm run dev (to start again)
```

---

## 🆘 EMERGENCY - WEBSITE NOT WORKING?

### The Nuclear Option (Fixes everything):
```bash
# Stop everything first (Ctrl + C)

# Delete and reinstall
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
npm install

# Start again
npm run dev
```

## 💡 TIPS & TRICKS:

### Tip 1: Keep Servers Running
- Don't close the terminals!
- Minimize them if you want

### Tip 2: Auto-Reload
- Change any file in `src/` folder
- Website updates automatically! (No need to restart)

### Tip 3: Multiple Devices
